# Vision Statement
### Group-14
### Data-301

We are a group of three students in three different majors: Data Science, Computer Science, and Economics. We are interested in European soccer, focusing on the Premier League matches data set from 2014-2020. We chose this data set since there are a lot of categories that can be approached from different perspectives. 

We aim to analyze the data from multiple perspectives and have a better understanding of what is going on in the exciting field of soccer. Analyzing this data will help us in the future to understand the game better from a statistical point of view. We hope to learn how to extract valuable information from the big dataset from different angles.
