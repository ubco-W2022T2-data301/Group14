    "The Premier League is one of the most famous football leagues in the world, known for its high intensity and level of players. The three of us; Takara Nishizaki, Omar Hemed, and Makoto Kitamura analyzed the Premier League games between 2014-2020 (The original data can be accessed from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/premier-league-matches-20142020) ) from various perspectives, to see if there is a strong correlation between certain factors. The data from the Premier League was chosen because all three of us have an interest in football, and wanted to analyze statistical data that we are interested in while having some prior knowledge as well. Through the various categories and factors that are in the game of football, we came up with three research questions that can be answered to analyze the game further from a statistical viewpoint. "

    " The main focus of my research question was to gather as much data as I could for the yellow and red cards for the away team and compare them with the home team. I gathered the information for both yellow and red cards and calculated them per year, I also got the mean of all teams and the mean for yellow and red cards. After getting into more depth about my question I concluded that the away team gets more yellow/red cards for multiple reasons. One of the reasons is that the away team is not playing with its own fans and field and that affects the players and how well they can perform in a match. "
